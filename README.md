# Cancer-data-classification-KNN-and-SVM

"Cancer Data" dataset from Kaggle will be used. Dataset contains informations about cancer patients and their characteristics.

The main task is to build a predictive model using the Cancer dataset from Kaggle to accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign. We will train several ML models(KNN and SVM), and compare their results.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifies new cancer example based on the majority class of its k closest neighbors, while Support Vector Machine (SVM) finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. Both models do well with binary problems.
